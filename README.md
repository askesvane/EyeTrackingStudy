# Children interactive playing behavior 
__An eye-tracking study__

## Description of the repository
This repository contains all scripts used to clean, wrangle, visualize, and prepare the data for subsequent analysis by Mihaela Taranu. 
In the experiment, 7 children played with 14 LEGO bricks across 3 consecutive iterations. Eye tracking data were recorded with Pupil Labs. The videos extracted from Pupil Labs were subsequently manually annotated in Boris. Each time a new fixation was made on a different brick a new manual code was annotated. Thus, the raw data partly originates from Pupil Lab and partly from Boris. Both Pupil Lab and Boris generated a csv-file for every iteration (block) resulting in a total of 21 Boris files and 21 Pupil Lab files. 






Pupil Labs data is very rich and contains a lot of fixations. 
Boris data has much less data.
